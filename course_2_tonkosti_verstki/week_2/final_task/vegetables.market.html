    Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family
    that bears usually cylindrical fruits, which are used as vegetables.[1] Considered an annual plant,[2]
    there are three main varieties of cucumber — slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless — within which
    several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now grows on most
    continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market. In North America, the
    term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely
    related.

    originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten
    part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are also eaten. The domestic carrot
    has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.</p>

<p class="vegetable__description carousel">
    A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above
    ground, on soil, or on its food source.
    The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence
    the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a
    stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap.
    "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is
    used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores
    that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.

    only the head is eaten – the edible white flesh sometimes called "curd" (with a similar appearance to
    cheese curd).[1] The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads
    resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. Brassica oleracea
    also includes broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, collectively called "cole"
    crops,[2] though they are of different cultivar groups.

    vegetable.
    It was once classified in the lily family, like the related Allium species, onions and garlic. However,
    genetic research places lilies, Allium, and asparagus in three separate families—the Liliaceae,
    Amaryllidaceae, and Asparagaceae, respectively— the Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae are grouped together
    in the order Asparagales. Sources differ as to the native range of Asparagus officinalis, but generally
    include most of Europe and western temperate Asia.[3][4][5][6] It is widely cultivated as a vegetable

    The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus),[1] also known by the names French artichoke and
    green artichoke in the U.S.,[2] is a variety of a species of thistle cultivated as a food.

    The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom. The
    budding artichoke flower-head is a cluster of many budding small flowers (an inflorescence), together
    with many bracts, on an edible base. Once the buds bloom, the structure changes to a coarse, barely
    edible form. Another variety of the same species is the cardoon, a perennial plant native to the
    Mediterranean region. Both wild forms and cultivated varieties (cultivars) exist.

    edible stem or hypocotyl, and shoots. Celeriac is like a root vegetable except it has a bulbous
    hypocotyl with many small roots attached.

    In the Mediterranean Basin and in Northern Europe, celeriac is widely cultivated.[3][2] It is also
    cultivated in North Africa, Siberia, Southwest Asia, and North America.[3] In North America, the
    'Diamant' cultivar predominates.[4]

<p class="vegetable__description carousel">
    Chayote[1] (Sechium edule), also known as mirliton, güisquil, pipinola and choko, is an edible plant
    belonging to the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. This fruit was first cultivated in the Mesoamericas
    between southern Mexico and Honduras, with the most genetic diversity available in both Mexico and
    Guatemala.[2] It is one of the several foods introduced to the Old World during the Columbian Exchange.
    Also during this period, the plant spread from to other parts of the Americas, ultimately causing it to
    be integrated into the cuisine of many other Latin American nations.

    The chayote fruit is mostly used cooked. When cooked, chayote is usually handled like summer squash; it
    is generally lightly cooked to retain the crispy consistency. Raw chayote may be added to salads or
    salsas, most often marinated with lemon or lime juice, but is often regarded as especially unpalatable
    and tough in texture. Whether raw or cooked, chayote is a good source of vitamin C.

    Although most people are familiar only with the fruit as being edible, the root, stem, seeds and leaves
    are edible as well. The tubers of the plant are eaten like potatoes and other root vegetables, while the
    shoots and leaves are often consumed in salads and stir fries, especially in Asia.

    The sweet potato or sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the bindweed
    or morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting, tuberous roots are used as a
    root vegetable.[1][2] The young shoots and leaves are sometimes eaten as greens. The sweet potato is
    distantly related to the common potato (Solanum tuberosum), both being in the order Solanales. Although
    the darker sweet potatoes are often referred to as "yams" in parts of North America, the species is not
    closely related to true yams.[3] Cultivars of the sweet potato have been bred to bear tubers with flesh
    and skin of various colors.
    Ipomoea batatas is native to the tropical regions of the Americas.[4][5] Of the approximately 50 genera
    and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major
    importance—some others are used locally (e.g., I. aquatica "kangkong"), but many are poisonous. The
    genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning
    glories, though that term is not usually extended to Ipomoea batatas. Some cultivars of Ipomoea batatas
    are grown as ornamental plants under the name tuberous morning glory, used in a horticultural context.

    taproot has cream-colored skin and flesh, and, left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in
    flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green
    leaves. If unharvested, in its second growing season it produces a flowering stem topped by an umbel of
    small yellow flowers, later producing pale brown, flat, winged seeds. By this time, the stem has become

    plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible
    fruit.
    Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a
    vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is
    related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant
    is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is
    usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the
    capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the
    culinary arts.
    It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species thorn or bitter apple, S.
    incanum,[6][7][8] probably with two independent domestications: one in South Asia, and one in East
    Asia.[9] In 2018, China and India combined accounted for 87% of the world production of eggplants.
